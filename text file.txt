This code takes a mathematical equation as user input, evaluates it, and then prints the result. The `eval()` function is used to execute the entered expression. 
However, be cautious with user input to avoid security risks associated with using `eval()`.

1 => equation = input("Enter an equation"): This line prompts the user to enter a mathematical equation. 
The input() function is used to take user input, and the entered equation is stored in the variable equation.

2=> print(eval(equation)): The entered equation, stored in the equation variable, is then passed to the eval() function. 
The eval() function evaluates the expression and returns the result. Finally, the result is printed using the print() function.

It's important to note that using eval() can be risky if the input is not controlled, as it can execute arbitrary code. 
In this case, since the user is prompted to enter an equation, it should be used cautiously to avoid potential security issues. 
Additionally, it assumes that the user provides a valid mathematical expression.
